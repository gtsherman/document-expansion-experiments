I originally took the optimal params for each vector size bucket in QL and ran a grid search over the RM3 params _given_ that vector size. But I realized that's not right, the correct optimal QL params should include the vector size as one of the parameters being optimized. So I created a new directory in each RM3 directory that contains the optimal params data snatched from the correct (optimal) vector size directory. In practice, this just means that each query is copied out of every fb* file in the correct vector size directory (because the optimal params besides vector size should already have been found _given_ the correct vector size, so the representation of the query in every file in the correct vector size directory is already correct).

The optimal_overall directory contains the cross validated runs that are the optimal found over _all_ vector sizes (each vector size using its particular optimal parameter settings). This is saved just in case, but it shouldn't be something I ever need, because it doesn't really make sense to set the vector size, then find the optimal other parameter settings for that given vector sizes, and _then_ allow vector size to vary (which is what these cv files are the result of).
